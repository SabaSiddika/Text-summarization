       " 'These consistent results over a long period of time point to the significance of an early vector control campaign in Bangladesh.',\n",
       " 'The month of June was the one in which we found the highest GF, suggesting the peak month for transmission, meaning that there were more secondary cases of dengue in June than any other month.',\n",
       " 'This might be due to the availability of vulnerable human hosts at the start of the transmission seasons along with favorable environmental variables (rainfall that coincides with higher temperatures).',\n",
       " 'June is one of the warmest months of the year in Bangladesh and the first month of the monsoon season.',\n",
       " 'More rapid transmission cycles and infection rates are anticipated as a result of the interaction between increased rainfall, which favorably influences Aedes mosquito breeding locations, and increased temperatures, which are predicted to shorten the extrinsic incubation period and biting interval .',\n",
       " 'We argue that starting the vector-control program in April would be ideal because the estimated GF began to exceed 1 in April and remained above 1 through July.',\n",
       " 'Our analysis revealed that the early transmission season (April–July), when dengue cases are rising at a higher rate, presents an opportunity to launch the vector control program sooner and more successfully reduce dengue incidence.',\n",
       " 'We advise trying out earlier community involvement for eradicating Aedes breeding areas, since this could improve overall control and possibly lower case occurrence.']"
